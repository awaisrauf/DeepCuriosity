Lahore is known for its literary circles. India Tea House was major hub for intellectuals especially left-leaning, progressives of subcontinent. After partition, India Tea House became Pak Tea House but it keep on embracing progressives. But in the last two or three decades, much has changed. Pak Tea House got closed in 2000 and progressives disappeared. 

Afkar-e-Taza (new thoughts) ThinkFest seems to be an effort to bring this environment of free discussion back. It is a two day 
event, held by Information Technology University's Center of Governance and Policy (CGP) every year. Yaqoob Bangish, a 
prominent historian, writer and faculty member of ITU is its major architect and steward. Thinkers, historians, journalist, 
academics and intellectuals from around the globe and especially from subcontinent attend it and discuss issues that impact 
this region. This year's ThinkFest was second successful episode arranged in famous Alhamra Art Council along side historical 
mall road. Fortunately, I was able to attend this year's ThinkFest. In this blog, I will try to document some discussions and 
arguments I was able to witness.

First panel discussion was on future of democracy in Pakistan, hosted by Najam Sethi. Role of establishment and declining democratic tradition was discussed. A number of concerns on democratic norms and role of military establishment were raised. One interesting point on which both participants were agreed was that military now understands that a military coup not an option. While I agreed with panel on limiting the role of military in politics and democratic process, I disagree on their approach. The beauty of democracy is its evolutionary process. A revolutionary wipe out of major stake holders such as military establishment is not possible in democratic process. Instead of heedlessly following this goal, we should focus on gradual limitation of non-democratic forces. We can learn lessons from birth place of democracy, United Kingdom where powerful monarchy and parliament co-existed for long period eventually paving ways for total democratic society. 

Another point on which I disagreed was that political parties tend to be corrupt so it shouldn't be a major concern. Guests gave example of India where a major number of parliamentarians have corruption and criminal charges. Unfortunately, we are very different from the India in the senses that we have strong military which thinks of itself as savior of Pakistan. The major excuse for all the military coups was corruption so we should not ignore this point.

Second panel discussion was on Kartarpur border opening and future of Punjab. This discussion was in Punjabi and made me nostalgic. First time in my life, I had seen Punjabi intellectuals with left leaning. Their discussion realized me that I had never been exposed to Punjabi literature and there is serious gap. From last few years, I have felt that Punjabi culture and language attracts me. I have seen movies on pre-partition Punjabi culture and have listened to folksongs thanks to coke-studio. These are only two mediums available as Punjabi literature is almost non-existent in Pakistan.

Panel discussion on history of Punjab was interesting. They demystified myth of Punjab always bowing down to foreign invaders. They also discussed role of Britishers in breaking of Punjabi culture and norms in an effort to get access into Afghanistan and neighboring regions. Britishers banned Punjabi and made Urdu as lingua franca. They made propaganda literature on previous Punjabi rulers and started communal problems among Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs. After partition, Punjab was divided first into Indian and Pakistani Punjab and then even more divisions after partition in both Indian and Pakistani Punjab. Original Punjab consisted of Kashmir, some areas of KPK, Sindh and three provinces of India. They gave valid arguments against recent suggestion of division of Pakistani Punjab into two parts. Speakers argued that we should exclude religion from Kartarpur and should focus on Punjab's debate. Unfortunately, some racist remarks were also made by the guests which made event a bit bad.



I was late in third panel discussion on foreign policy but I was able to had a discussion with panelist Moueed Yousaf, prominent academic, journalist and foreign policy expert. I asked him a question that always intrigues me: "Why USA invade countries?". I can understand motives of British Kingdom but invasions of USA are different. Cold war era madness or invasion of Afghanistan can be understood on the basis of war hysteria and fear. But what about invasion of Iraq, Syria and Libya? There is no profit motive as all invasion were very costly. Democracy rhetoric can also be refuted based on Iraq and Afghanistan experience. He made the argument that countries do make blunders. It is easy for us to look back and see mistakes but very difficult to predict at the time. He also suggested Israel's hand as these three states were prime threat for the country's existence.

Another interesting and long discussion was with veteran journalist and writer Murtaza Solangi. He was disappointed with major political parties such as PPPP and PMLN. PPPP, according to him, is party of money landers and elites and PMLN is voice of business community. This has created a political black hole as there is no voice for middle and lower class. He told me that PMLN is full of people who want to join echelons of power even if they had to break a deal with the establishment. I asked him future role of PTM and how we actually need likes of PTM to limit non-democratic powers. He agreed with me on PTM's role but was very skeptic of any major role of such small "movements".

One question, I always had in my mind is about the camps of journalists. It seems like journalist in Pakistan don't just support democracy but rather they tend to be in camps, anti or pro establishment. His answers were not that much convincing.  



Next session was on Past and Future of Afghanistan. One of the guests was grand child of British ambassador at Afghanistan at the time of partition. Her book on British era Afghanistan is End Game. She told origins of Afhgan-Pak conflict and how Pakistan's failed policy made things worse at the time of independence. Interesting views were presented by Afrasiab Khatak, ex ANP senator and a prominent Pashtoon leader from KPK. He warned about the possible Taliban govt in Afghanistan could be dangerous for Pakistan as well as it can make Pakistani Taliban stronger. He discussed how strong cultural ties between the countries can be used to make relationships better for both countries. He suggested that there is change of mindset in Pakistani establishment. Third guest was a security analyst from UK who reveled some interesting facts about Taliban and suggested that USA does not feel any threat from Taliban but China and other regional powers may not feel comfortable with them.

After the session, I had a brief discussion with Afrasiab Khatak. I am very curious about PTM, a movement started by some intelligent and well-read Pashtoon people against the oppression in FATA. I asked him about ANP's future and what is future of leftist politics in Pashtoon belt. PTM, according to him, is a result of ANP's failure for becoming the voice of oppressed people of FATA.

Last and most interesting discussion was about upcoming Indian election how they can effect peace process started by Pakistan. One of the guests were Khursheed Qusori, former foreign minister and architect of 6 point peace formula that almost solved Kashmir issue in 2006-07. He discussed his efforts for peace and excitement on both side when he suggested peace process. He revealed some interesting things about Mumbai attacks and how US defused flames of war between the two countries.

This discussion was also joined by an Indian academic who is acclaimed critic of Indian policies in Kashmir. His views on Kashmir and peace process were different. He said that only way to the peace is solution of Kashmir issue in terms stop of human rights violation. He also claimed that people in India have fed up by Modi and its likely that he will not be next PM even if BJP wins. He told us that Pakistan is not that much of an issues in this elections and economy will likely decide fate of the election.
