akistan recently held its general elections and new party's government has been elected. This newly elected government
came with a reformist agenda and started implementing it reforms by making task forces and advisory councils consisting of renown professionals, 
academics and other stakeholders. One such advisory council was established for reforms in country's deteriorating economy by 
finance minister [Asad Umar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asad_Umar) having four economists from famous international universities.
One of these academics was [Atif Mian](https://scholar.princeton.edu/atif/home) belonging to a minority group having historical 
issues with Muslim majority. This selection causes widespread criticism and government had to take its decision back. This was very
disappointing as a professional should be evaluated on his/her skills rather than his/her affiliation with a group. Internet was full of
argument form both sides and it seems like an action that could damage reformist agenda of the party. Seeing this mess, I decided to read 
some well researched book to understand what really makes countries fail in the long run and how this "resignation" can effect us in the long run. 
In this quest, I came across this book "Why Nations Fail" by two development economists from MIT and Harvard. In my very first blog, I will be presenting 
my view on the book and answers and sense of relief I got from this book. 

This books basically presents a new theory to explain reasons for why some nations prosper while many other, even neighbors, linger behind. Heart of the 
theory lies in two terms: inclusive and extractive institutions. Extractive institutions do their best for the benefits of a narrow group of elites, exploiting
resources to benefit a few and 
inclusive institutions work for the "many". They theorize that countries with more inclusive economical and political institutions tend to get prosperous 
while extractive economical and political institutes makes countries fail. To force their argument of inclusive-extractive institutions, authors starts with
example of two neighboring towns at Mexico-USA border and explains inequality between geographically neighboring and its relation with inclusive and extractive 
institutions by first explaining historical roots of both country's systems and then their present shape. 

This book sees every historical event from neolithic revolution, Roman empire's rise and fall, great Mayan civilization, European colonization, Glorious 
Revolution to Industrial revolution with a lens of inclusive-extractive institutions. Their theory suggests that a sustainable growth is only possible if 
country's system is pluralistic where voice of many is heard and acted upon while countries with absolutist regime tend to fail even if they got short term
success. One major example of this theory is how British and USA got so much prosperous while Soviet Union, even after a short period of rapid growth fall behind.
After Magna Carta in thirteen century, power of crown started to decline and people started becoming more and more involved in the political process. This forced parliament to start listing to 
people making political institutions more and more plural. On the other hand, Soviet Union was under an absolutist regime where individuals had no say in the 
process. This made political and then in turn economical institutions more and more extractive and thus in the turn stopping short lived progress. 

Another important aspect of this theory is critical juncture: a defining moment in history such as Black death and glorious revolution in Great Britain, French revolution, 
civil war in USA, independence for European colonies etc. Authors argued that little improvements towards inclusiveness plays major role at the time of critical 
juncture. For instance, since there were inclusiveness in Britain's institutions at the time of golorious revolution so it
