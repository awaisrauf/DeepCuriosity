title: My resolutions about AI and why I am sharing it

### Why this?
According to many [studies in psychology](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/am-i-right/201404/the-astonishing-power-social-pressure),
 social pressure can force us to do things that we may not do otherwise. While social pressure can do cause harm (for instance, depression when we compare ourselves with others in terms of social status), I have found an interesting hack to use it for betterment. Recently, I observed whenever I share my ongoing work on social media, I tend to complete it on time. For instance, Once, I pledged to read a long and dry book on Facebook. Surprisingly, I completed it in record time. Similarly, when I made the [bookshelf](https://awaisrauf.github.io/bookshelf/) to track my readings, my speed and interest increased suddenly. Looking at this, I decided to use this hack in even better way: by introducing it in my learning curve of artificial intelligence.

 ### Why AI?
Kai-Fu nominated artificial intelligence as fourth industrial revolution after steam engine, electricity and ICT in his recent [book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38242135-ai-superpowers).
 Andrew Ng called it [electricity of the future](https://medium.com/syncedreview/artificial-intelligence-is-the-new-electricity-andrew-ng-cc132ea6264).
 Due to its utmost importance, I decided to make a career out of it in 2017 when I started working with [Spider Lab](http://spider.itu.edu.pk).
 While I have learned and achieved a lot (completed many online courses,
 became [TA for ML course](https://awaisrauf.github.io/ee512/),
 [won a data science competition](https://propakistani.pk/2018/08/01/first-ever-election-prediction-contest-in-pakistan-concludes/),
 [published a paper in NeurIPS workshop](https://awaisrauf.github.io/xray-denoising) and will be starting my Ph.D. in this field soon) since, 
 I think this is not enough. The field is accelerating rapidly, [double exponential according to Elon Musk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3PV9xMSfSs). To cope with this pace and to complete my AI related dreams, I have decided to pledged to complete at least 100 courses and books on this field in the next 3 years.
 I also have decided to systematically track and share my progress thereby using the "magic" of social pressure. I will use this page to track and share these pledges for this road map. 
 


### 1. Courses
This section will act as to-do list of all the courses I have completed recently or wanted to complete in the future. All the courses are 
related to sub-fields of artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science and statistics. In specific order of completion.
