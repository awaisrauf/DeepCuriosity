### Why this?
According to many [studies in psychology](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/am-i-right/201404/the-astonishing-power-social-pressure),
 social pressure can force us to do things that we may not do otherwise. While social pressure can do much harm (for instance, depression when we compare ourselves with others in terms of social status), I have found an interesting hack to use it for my good. Recently, I observed that whenever I share my ongoing work on social media, I tend to complete it on time. For instance, Once I pledged to read a long and dry book on
 Facebook. Surprisingly, I completed it in record time. Similarly, when I made the [bookshelf](https://awaisrauf.github.io/bookshelf/) to track my readings, my speed and interest increased suddenly. Therefore, I decided to get this hack even further.

Kai-Fu nominated artificial intelligence as fourth industrial revolution after steam engine, electricity and ICT in his recent [book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38242135-ai-superpowers).
 Andrew Ng called it [electricity of the future](https://medium.com/syncedreview/artificial-intelligence-is-the-new-electricity-andrew-ng-cc132ea6264).
 Due to its utmost importance, I decided to make a career out of it in 2017 when I started working with [Spider Lab](http://spider.itu.edu.pk).
 While I have learned and achieved a lot (completed many online courses,
 became [TA for ML course](https://awaisrauf.github.io/ee512/),
 [won a data science competition](https://propakistani.pk/2018/08/01/first-ever-election-prediction-contest-in-pakistan-concludes/),
 [published a paper in NeurIPS workshop](https://awaisrauf.github.io/xray-denoising)) since then and will be starting my Ph.D. in this field soon, 
 I think this is not enough. The field is accelerating rapidly, [double exponential according to Elon Musk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3PV9xMSfSs). Therefore, I pledged to complete at least 100 courses plus books combined in the next 3 years.
 I also have decided to systematically track and share my progress thereby using the magic of social pressure. I will use this page to track these pledges for this road map. 
 


### 1. Courses
This section keeps track of all the courses I have completed recently or wanted to complete in future. All the courses are 
related to sub-fields of artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science statistics etc. Order shows real order in which I would 
like to complete them.
