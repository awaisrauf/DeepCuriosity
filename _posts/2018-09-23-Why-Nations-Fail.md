Pakistan recently held its general elections and a new party’s government has been elected. This newly elected government came with a reformist agenda and started implementing it reforms by making task forces and advisory councils consisting of renown professionals, academics and other stakeholders. One such advisory council was established for reforms in country’s deteriorating economy by finance minister Asad Umar having four economists from famous international universities. One of these academics was Atif Mian who belongs to a minority group having historical issues with the Muslim majority. This selection created widespread criticism and government had to take its decision back. This was very disappointing as a professional should be evaluated on his/her skills rather than his/her religious affiliation. His resignation too provoked a storm and the internet was full of argument form both sides. From the internet, it appeared like an action that could damage the reformist agenda of the party or a revolutionary step. Seeing this political mess, I decided to read some well-researched book to understand what really makes countries fail in the long run and how this “resignation” can affect Pakistan. In this quest, I came across this book “Why Nations Fail” by two development economists from MIT and Harvard. In my very first blog, I will be presenting a review of the book and answers and sense of relief I got from this book.


### Theory of Prosperity 
<img src="https://awaisrauf.github.io/bookshelf/imgs/why_nations_fail.jpg" style="width:15%;">

This books basically presents a new theory to explain reasons for why some nations prosper while many other, even neighbors, linger behind. Heart of the 
theory lies in two terms: inclusive and extractive institutions. Extractive institutions do their best for the benefits of a narrow group of elites, exploiting
resources to benefit a few and 
inclusive institutions work for the "many". They theorize that countries with more inclusive economical and political institutions tend to get prosperous 
while extractive economical and political institutes makes countries fail. To force their argument of inclusive-extractive institutions, authors starts with
example of two neighboring towns at Mexico-USA border and explains inequality between geographically neighboring and its relation with inclusive and extractive 
institutions by first explaining historical roots of both country's systems and then their present shape. 
### Lessons from History
This book sees every historical event from neolithic revolution, Roman empire's rise and fall, great Mayan civilization, European colonization, Glorious 
Revolution to Industrial revolution with a lens of inclusive-extractive institutions. Their theory suggests that a sustainable growth is only possible if 
country's system is pluralistic where voice of many is heard and acted upon while countries with absolutist regime tend to fail even if they got short term
success. One major example of this theory is how British and USA got so much prosperous while Soviet Union, even after a short period of rapid growth fall behind.
After Magna Carta in thirteen century, power of crown started to decline and people started becoming more and more involved in the political process. This forced parliament to start listing to 
people making political institutions more and more plural. On the other hand, Soviet Union was under an absolutist regime where individuals had no say in the 
process. This made political and then in turn economical institutions more and more extractive and thus in the turn stopping short lived progress. 

Another important aspect of this theory is critical juncture: a defining moment in history such as Black death and glorious revolution in Great Britain, French revolution, 
civil war in USA, independence for European colonies etc. Authors argued that little improvements towards inclusiveness plays major role at the time of critical 
juncture. For instance, since there were some inclusiveness in Britain's institutions at the time of glorious revolution, a critical juncture, it made it possible 
for parliamentary forces to win similarly Australia and USA got benefited from Industrial Revolution, another critical juncture, due to inclusive nature of their institutions. Many African and
Asian countries were unable to reap the benefits of industrial revolution or independence due to the lack of these institutions.

Authors then describe vicious and virtuous cycle of extractive and inclusive institutions i.e. extractive institutions reinforces path for even more inclusive that tend to be long term while
virtuous cycle exactly inverse of it making nations fail for so many years. While all these factors do play an important rule, there is another contingent part of history. Take example of
black death that shock foundations of feudalism and serfdom in Britain by when peasants started movements. On the other hand, similar efforts of serfs failed in many eastern European countries after the
the same black death. 

Book presents a lot of historical events from around the globe from neolithic revolution to as recent 2010's Arab spring revolution and discusses it from presepective. Though book is lengthy with 460+ pages but 
it presents a very sane argument with strong historical background its worth a shot. I would rate it 4.3 stars out of 5. Its definately a must read for every one who wanted to get involved in political process of the country for better.
### Answers to my questions
Lastly, I got a wave of relief after reading it in such a times of political mess. I think it is better that more and more people are getting involved in the political process and making it harder for government to do wrong. A government that responds for people's call is better in the long run as it tend to represent common good.
